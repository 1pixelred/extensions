##### What is 1PIXEL.RED?

1PIXEL.RED is a unique NFT game based on the Flow blockchain. Due to the low entry threshold, which requires only an email address, we will be able to involve website owners and their users in the gameplay.

The essence of the game is that website owners (webmasters) add their domain names to the blockchain, and users (websurfers) find red pixels on the pages of the added websites. Whoever finds the red pixel first gets a unique NFT token for that website. Users do not know which website is in the game because the domain names are hashed before being sent to the blockchain and are stored encrypted in the blockchain. Thus finding a red pixel will be a surprise to the user.

The player doesn't know which website is in play, but let's say he accidentally goes to flow.com (example). The most normal visit to the website, but suddenly a red pixel appears, which sometimes you can not notice. Don't rush to take the monitor to a repair shop. After you click on the pixel, it disappears and the browser extension opens and gives you the opportunity to get an NFT token for the website where you found the pixel.

The new NFT token is in your collection, and opening the browser extension shows you a list of the tokens you now own.
